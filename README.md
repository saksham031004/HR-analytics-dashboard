📈 HR Analytics Dashboard: Driving Workforce Insights
🥇 Project Title: HR Analytics Dashboard
🎯 Short Description / Purpose
This Power BI dashboard is a dynamic and interactive data visualization project designed for Human Resources (HR) Analytics. It provides a compelling visual analysis of key HR datasets, enabling managers and HR professionals to quickly identify patterns, risks, and opportunities within the workforce.


The primary goals of this dashboard are to:

Monitor Workforce Health: Track key metrics related to employee headcount, demographics, and compensation.

Analyze Attrition: Identify and drill down into the factors contributing to employee turnover (e.g., department, job role, tenure).

Support Data-Driven Decisions: Provide actionable insights for recruitment strategies, retention programs, and employee engagement initiatives.

The dashboard is built using standard Power BI tools  and is likely associated with a tutorial series by Rishabh Mishra (as indicated in the file name).


🛠️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following core tools and technologies, as evidenced by the Power BI file structure:



📊 Power BI Desktop – The primary platform used for data modeling, visualization design, and report creation.


📂 Power Query (M Language) – Used for data extraction, cleaning, shaping, and transforming the raw HR dataset (e.g., handling null values, standardizing department names).


🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Employed for creating calculated measures and columns essential for HR analysis (e.g., Attrition Rate, Average Tenure, Headcount Month-over-Month).


📝 Data Modeling – Established relationships between various HR tables (e.g., employee master, performance, separation records) to ensure accurate cross-filtering and metric aggregation.


📁 File Format – Developed as a Power BI Report file (.pbix).

📊 Data Source
The project relies on a rich, internal-facing Human Resources dataset.

Source: Likely a synthesized or anonymized dataset representing typical corporate HR records, often used in public tutorials.

Data Content: The HR dataset would typically include records on:

Employee Demographics: Age, Gender, Education, Marital Status.

Job Details: Department, Job Role, Job Level, Business Travel.

Performance & Satisfaction: Performance Rating, Environment Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance.

Compensation: Daily/Hourly/Monthly Rate, Stock Option Level.

Attrition & Tenure: Attrition Status (Yes/No), Years at Company, Years in Current Role.

✨ Features / Highlights
Goal of the Dashboard
To create an intuitive, drill-down interface for HR data, simplifying complex comparisons across different employee segments and pinpointing key organizational performance indicators.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals (Likely)
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Total Active Employees (Headcount)

Overall Attrition Rate

Average Employee Salary

Average Tenure (Years)

Attrition Deep Dive:

Bar charts showing Attrition Rate by Department and Job Role (e.g., 'Sales Representatives' vs. 'Managers').

Categorical breakdowns of attrition by factors like Education Field and Business Travel Frequency.

Demographic Analysis:

Distribution charts (e.g., histograms or box plots) showing Employee Age Distribution and Gender Split.

Visualizations exploring how Work-Life Balance or Job Satisfaction correlate with the attrition rate.

Time Series Analysis:

A line chart showing Employee Headcount Trend Over Time or Monthly Attrition Count to spot seasonal patterns.
